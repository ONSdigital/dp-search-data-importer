### Healthcheck

 The `/health` endpoint returns the current status of the service. Dependent services are health checked on an interval defined by the `HEALTHCHECK_INTERVAL` environment variable.

 On a development machine a request to the health check endpoint can be made by:

 `curl localhost:25900/health`
